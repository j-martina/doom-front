# `doom-front` and `doom-lsp`

## About

`doom-front` is meant to be a comprehensive suite of Rust frontends for the myriad domain-specific languages used by the collective ecosystem of Doom source ports, including those of the [ZDoom](https://zdoom.org/index) family, [Eternity Engine](https://eternity.youfailit.net/wiki/Main_Page), DeHackEd, and UMAPINFO.

`doom-lsp` is meant to build off of `doom-front` to create a [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)-compliant language server for assisting Doom development and modification.

The former is also intended to help in facilitating the development of future, backwards-compatible source ports in Rust.
